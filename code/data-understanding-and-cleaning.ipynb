The cricketer’s tendon ‘ripped apart’ from his quadricep and he had to go under the knife to recover.\nRecalling his recovery period, when he had to be away from the cricket ground due to his thigh injury, Rahul told Star Sports, “She was more frustrated and angry than I was. I found myself trying to keep her calm as it was the first time she was seeing me go through something like this.” However, the Mubarakan actor gave a “lot of love” to her husband while he was recovering. Rahul added, “It was tough for both of us but it also gave us time that we needed together. She gave me a lot of love.”\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.
